# About

This project is the basis of all of my apps.  It is created with create-react-app and outfitted with
critical features such as: global state management, routing, SCSS and theme exports for dynamic use in JavaScript files etc.
Furthermore, it demonstrates back-end setup with express, including routing and mongoose schema's, in addition to
payload validation etc.

Although you can clone and run this app with `yarn start`, this is meant to be a look at the bones of an app on GitHub only.
